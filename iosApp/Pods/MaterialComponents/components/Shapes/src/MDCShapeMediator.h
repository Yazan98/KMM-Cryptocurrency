@protocol MDCShapeGenerating;

/*
 Shape support addition to a layer.

 This class is used to add Shape support to a given view by providing it with the view's main layer.
 Having shape support means that by setting a shapeGenerator, you are able to have a custom shape
 using a custom path for that view.

 To have your instantiating view's backgroundColor, borderColor, and borderWidth also follow the
 custom shape, your view must have these APIs internally set and get from MDCShapeMediator's
 corresponding shapedBackgroundColor, shapedBorderColor, and shapedBorderWidth properties.

 This class exists to supersede MDCShapedShadowLayer which previously added shape support by
 overriding the layerClass and subclassing MDCShadowLayer, which are both behaviors we want to no
 longer support due to their complexity and constraints.

 have the border and background properties as well as its shadow path be up to date with the shape's
 custom path it gets through the shapeGenerator API.
